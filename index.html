            <p>My favorite animal is the Koala bear. A lot of people choose their favorite animal because they think it is an amazing creature. I chose the koala bear because it is so bad at existing that it's great.</p>
            <p>An example of how bad at being alive it is, is the fact that it chose a plant which has so little nutrients and is so hard to digest as it's only source of food, that in order to digest it correctly it has to eat large amounts of dirt to help.
                It is so bad at existing that if you took its food and put it on a plate for it, it would no loonger recognise it as food and die before it ate it.
